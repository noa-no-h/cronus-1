You will be given a user's goals and a list of template categories.
Your task is to generate a list of 3-5 relevant categories tailored to the user's specific goals. For each category, you must suggest a name, description, color, a boolean for isProductive, and a single emoji.

IMPORTANT: Prefer using the provided template categories when they broadly cover an activity. Only create a new category if no template is a good fit.

Instructions details:
- If a user's goal is to "build the windows version of the app", the existing "Coding" category is a better choice than creating a new, highly specific "Windows Development" category.
- No need to only use the default categories. For ex. if someone says they have drawing as a hobby, they might need a "Drawing" category (in that case we dont use the "Design" category).
- If a user is a "CPA", they might need new categories like "Bookkeeping", "Tax", and "Consulting", since these are not in the template list.
- Don't litterally use XYZ but fill in the name of the specific company, project, client, etc.
- We already add a "Distraction" and a "Friends & Social" category, so no need to add them as part of your 3-5 categories.

Here are some good default categories that work for many people:
- name: Work Communication, description: Responding to emails, Slack, Notion, meetings or async updates, emoji: üí¨, isProductive: true
- name: Contracting for XYZ, description: Working on a project for Contractor work for XYZ including meetings, emails, etc. related to that project
- name: Planning & Reflection, description: Journaling, reflecting on goals, or reviewing personal plans, emoji: üìù, isProductive: true

- name: Coding, description: Writing or reviewing code, debugging, working in IDEs or terminals, emoji: üíº, isProductive: true
- name: Design, description: Working in design tools like Figma or Illustrator on UX/UI or visual assets, emoji: üé®
- name: Product Management, description: Planning features, writing specs, managing tickets, reviewing user feedback, emoji: üìà, isProductive: true
- name: Fundraising, description: Pitching to investors, refining decks, writing emails or grant applications, emoji: üí∞, isProductive: true
- name: Growth & Marketing, description: Working on campaigns, analytics, user acquisition, SEO or outreach, emoji: üöÄ, isProductive: true
- name: Dating, description: Using dating apps, messaging, browsing profiles, or going on dates, emoji: ‚ù§Ô∏è, isProductive: false
- name: Eating & Shopping, description: Eating meals, cooking, groceries, or online/in-person shopping, emoji: üçî, isProductive: false
- name: Sport & Health, description: Exercising, walking, gym, sports, wellness, etc., emoji: üí™, isProductive: true
- name: Commuting, description: Traveling to or from work, errands, or social events, emoji: üöó, isProductive: false

For the color, use Notion-style color like #3B82F6, #A855F7, #F97316, #CA8A04, #10B981, #06B6D4, #6B7280, #8B5CF6, #D946EF, #F59E0B, #22C5E, etc. (Don't use #EC4899)
