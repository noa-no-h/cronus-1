## ��️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Bun (latest version)
- MongoDB
- Stripe account (for payments)
- Google OAuth credentials

### Environment Variables

Contact the project maintainer to get the required environment variables. You'll need to set up:

- MongoDB connection string
- Stripe API keys
- Google OAuth credentials
- Other service-specific keys

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/whatdidyougetdonetoday-ai.git
cd whatdidyougetdonetoday-ai
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
bun install
```

3. **Start the development servers**

For the React admin frontend:

```bash
cd client
bun dev
```

For the backend:

```bash
cd server
bun dev
```

### Running the Server and Electron App Together

To run both the backend server and the Electron application concurrently for development:

```bash
bun run dev:electron-server
```

## Monorepo Structure

This project uses a monorepo structure with four main packages:

### Next.js Client (`/nextjs-client`)

- Marketing website and landing pages
- Built with Next.js 13+ App Router
- Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI components
- Blog system with markdown support
- SEO optimized

### Admin Client (`/client`)

- Built with Create React App + Craco
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- Implements Shadcn UI components
- Handles all admin logic and UI

### Server (`/server`)

- Bun-based backend
- tRPC for type-safe API endpoints
- MongoDB integration with Mongoose
- Handles authentication and payments
- AI categorization services

### Shared (`/shared`)

- Contains shared TypeScript types
- Used by both client and server
- Ensures type safety across the stack

### Electron App (`/electron-app`)

- A desktop application built with Electron, React, and TypeScript
- Native system integration for automatic time tracking
- Cross-platform support (macOS, Windows, Linux)
- For more details, see the [Electron App README](./electron-app/README.md)

## Deployment

The application is set up as a monorepo with separate deployment targets:

- **Next.js Website**: Deploy the `nextjs-client` directory to Vercel or similar
- **Admin Client**: Deploy the `client` directory to a static hosting service
- **Backend**: Deploy the `server` directory to a Node.js hosting service
- **Desktop App**: Build and distribute via GitHub Releases or similar

## 📱 Building and Running the Electron App

The Electron app uses [Electron Builder](https://www.electron.build/) for packaging and distribution. For detailed instructions on building, code signing, and publishing new releases, please refer to the dedicated README in the Electron app directory:

[**➡️ Electron App Build and Release Guide (`electron-app/README.md`)**](./electron-app/README.md)

This guide covers:

- Development builds
- Production builds (signed `.app` and `.dmg`)
- Code signing setup
- Publishing releases with OTA updates to S3

## �� Debugging

### Viewing Logs on macOS

The native Objective-C modules use Apple's Unified Logging system (`os_log`). To view these logs for debugging purposes:

1. Open the **Console.app** on macOS.
2. Start the Cronus application.
3. In the search bar of the Console app, enter the following filter and press Enter:
   ```
   subsystem:com.cronus.app
   ```
   This will display all log messages generated by the native modules, which is essential for diagnosing issues related to window tracking and native code execution.
